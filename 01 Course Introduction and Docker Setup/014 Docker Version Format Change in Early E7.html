            <p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Versions are now <code>YY.MM</code>based (like Ubuntu) and you can choose *Stable* (slower) or *Edge* (faster) releases. This means that newer features drop faster in Edge releases, and fixes are backported for a longer timeline to Stable releases. Everyone wins.</p>

<p>There may be mentions of <code>1.12</code> and <code>1.13</code> in this course, which were the two versions before <code>17.03</code>. <code>1.13.1</code> is actually the same features as <code>17.03.0</code>, so if you see <code>1.13</code> on my screen recording and <code>17.04</code> or similar in your CLI, it's fine!</p>













<p><strong>Big News:</strong> <strong>Docker versioning, release cycle, and product name has changed, but features haven't.</strong><a href="https://blog.docker.com/2017/03/docker-enterprise-edition/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Full details are here</a>, but my commentary on important highlights are below:</p>

























<ul><li><strong>Docker Engine</strong>(the free one we all know and love) <strong>is now Docker CE</strong>(Community Edition). Notice the drop of the word <em>Engine</em>. I suspect we can just call this Docker now. It includes the cli client and backend daemon/service and api (just like it did before). You can get it the same ways as before.</li><li><strong>Docker Data Center is now Docker EE</strong>(Enterprise Edition) and adds additional <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?offering=enterprise&amp;type=edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">paid products and support</a>on top of Docker in three pricing tiers.</li><li>These changes don't affect Docker Compose or Docker Machine.</li><li><strong>Docker's version is now <code>YY.MM</code>based</strong>, using the month of its expected release, and the first one will be <code>17.03.0</code>, which is "the first point release" of the <code>17.03</code>release. If any bug/security fixes are needed to that release, the first update will be <code>17.03.1</code>etc.</li><li>We now have two release tracks (called variants) "Edge" and "Stable".<ul><li>Edge is released monthly and supported for a month.</li></ul><ul><li>Stable is released quarterly and support for 4 months.</li></ul></li><ul><li>You can extend Stable's support and backported fixes through a <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?offering=enterprise&amp;type=edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Docker EE subscription</a>.</li></ul></ul>

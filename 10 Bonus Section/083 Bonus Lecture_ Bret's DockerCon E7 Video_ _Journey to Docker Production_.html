            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdUcKtg84T8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube video of my talk</a> at DockerCon17 in Austin. My largest audience ever (1k maybe) so Iwas excited and nervous at first.It turned into awell received talk toapacked room of people ready to go production Docker. Lots of Q&amp;Aat the end.</p><p>Then I did it again for DockerCon EU 6 months later! Ithink this one is better, and more fun, because I give you 80's and 90's video game trivia along the way. You can <a href="https://dockercon.docker.com/watch/WdAeLaLuSCNQwEp61YVXUt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">watch this improved and revised version on Docker's site</a> (it requires you give them your email, sorry).</p>

<p>Italkabout many of the decisions you need to make when taking your Docker containers from local dev/test to a production cluster. It covers decisions like:</p>



<ul><li>What host OSshould Iuse?</li><li>What base FROMimages should I use?</li><li>How should my Swarm node design look?</li><li>What other tools besides Swarm do Ineed for production containers?</li><li>What common issues do people have when starting a production docker project?</li><li>How to limit the project from trying to changetoo much at once.</li><li>How to speed up the project by outsourcing small pieces of solution to existing products.</li><li>How Docker's Enterprise/Cloud products can help.</li></ul>

1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,160
Okay.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,100
Let's talk about Docker Cloud. Docker Cloud used to be called Tutum. Then, a few years back, Docker bought

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,200
them and converted it into Docker Cloud.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,780
And they've been adding new features ever since. As a high level, Docker Cloud does two main things.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,920
It is not a cloud hoster.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,030
It is simply, on one side of it,

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,090
a web based orchestration system for your swarms and your Docker clusters. For those that already have

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,600
an Amazon, or an AWS, or Digital Ocean account and maybe don't want to use the CLI to deploy apps

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,070
or manage their servers,

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,900
they can use Docker Cloud to do that.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,180
You'll see on the left here where I can create stacks and services and containers like we've been talking

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,640
about.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,910
And then I can actually go down to nodes and provision them, including a simple little form that allows

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,400
me to create new nodes, which are basically servers on cloud hosters. And you can see I've enabled Digital

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,960
Ocean and Azure.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,030
This would basically save me a few steps if I was wanting to deploy some infrastructure. And then, once

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,700
my infrastructure is created into the clusters, I can just copy and paste stack files in, and away we

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,470
go.

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,080
There's a new beta feature that came out this spring that allows us to use the latest 113 Swarm Modes

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,140
in here as well.

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,050
And the bonus of that, if you're on Windows or Mac, is that if you add or create swarms in here they will

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,330
actually show up in the GUI on your Mac or your Windows machine. And you'll be able to launch the Docker

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,790
CLI against that swarm.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,230
So that's one side of cloud.

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,220
The other side is the build area.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,050
Earlier, we looked at Docker Hub and how you could do automated builds of your images with Ducker Hub

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,650
and include web hooks maybe from GitHub. But in Docker Cloud you can pay to have more of those features,

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,100
including running tests and doing more customization, such as having those images automatically deployed

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,920
to your servers that are linked to Docker Cloud.

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,640
This has become its own continuous integration platform where it's a one stop shop for building and

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,430
testing your images and then deploying them to your servers.

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,660
If I opened up one of my own images, we see that under builds I can configure automated builds.

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,000
And, lastly, one of the coolest things that Docker Cloud can do for you, is if you had your own private

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,350
images that you actually wanted to security scan for any known vulnerabilities, you can do that here.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,400
It's a paid service and I would go into one of these and set it up, and then pay for it through the Docker

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,650
Cloud subscription.

37
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,110
But you'll notice that that actually already is taking place on the official images.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,700
If I went to an official image, like Nginx, and then over to its tags, youll notice that theres

39
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,180
there's this vulnerabilities

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
graphic on the right here.

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,380
And, as I scroll down, typically each version is different in the vulnerability section.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,960
If you wanted, you can actually dive down into that image and find out exactly what layer the security

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,880
vulnerabilities appeared in.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,790
And then, also what those actual vulnerabilities are.

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,580
The list of vulnerabilities you're seeing here are actually produced by the CVE, which stands for

46
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,670
common vulnerabilities and exposures, and is actually run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,830
underneath the US-CERT program.

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,610
It's been around for years, if not decades.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,950
It's how we publicly track vulnerabilities in software today.

50
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,550
It's not specific to Docker. It's just Docker linking their scanning engine that goes through each one

51
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,670
of these updates to these official public images, and comparing the binaries and libraries in those

52
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,510
images to the open CVE database.

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,230
What's nice here is you can go through the list and click on each one and actually find out what's going

54
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,320
on and the status of it.

55
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,770
Usually, when I show people this for the first time, they think, holy cow look at all those vulnerabilities!

56
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,300
Well, this is the state of software today.

57
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,700
Sometimes this red line is just one or two.

58
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,300
Sometimes this red line is a lot. But, I wouldn't necessarily say don't use software with this red line.

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,640
I would say that every piece of software I've ever seen in Docker Hub has something red or orange, and

60
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,960
that's not indicative of the quality of the software. That's just kind of the reality of the world that

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,620
we're living in today, where vulnerabilities are found every day. And all of the official repositories

62
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,820
here are kept up to date within days of any fixes found.

63
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,250
What you would see here, in this case, is if any of these vulnerabilities in this list were fixed upstream,

64
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,030
then this image would be updated and rebuilt.

65
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,260
And this little marker would go down a little bit.

66
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,480
I encourage you to poke around some of your own images that you might be using

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,400
and check out their security issues. Because I do find this stuff rather interesting to just understand

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,220
how complex software today has gotten.

69
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,170
That's it for my demos of Docker Cloud and I encourage you to go there and try it out.

70
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,960
You can actually create one node and deploy an app for free and it will give you credits under the cloud

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,790
settings for the different cloud providers so that you can actually play around and learn how to use

72
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,830
it without having to pay for anything for maybe the first few weeks or a month.

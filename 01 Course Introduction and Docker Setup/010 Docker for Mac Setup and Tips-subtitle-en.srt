1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,180
Are you a Mac user and ready to use Docker.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,050
Well this lecture is going to get you all the tools you need to use this course with Docker and to get

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,550
the best doc or set up on your Mac.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,630
So the nice thing is I'm going to be using all the demos or at least most of the demos on my Mac so

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,160
it'll feel very native for you.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:30,320
The required version of Mac isn't actually even recent So you probably will be on the minimum version.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:37,760
It's actually a three year old OS at this point on Yosemite and really Yosemite works on every Mac hardware

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,450
for the last 10 years.

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:45,950
So as long as your laptop is less than 10 years old and you're using a version of Mac that was released

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,460
in the last three years that Docker for Mac product that you can get from store docker.com will work

11
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,150
and it's the best way to use Docker on your Mac.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:03,050
It has all the features and all the new bonus sort of ease of use things going on in terms of like networking

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,980
and storage and stuff.

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,970
And we'll get into that.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,960
But that's really the best way to go if for some reason you can't do that.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,260
Maybe your office that you use your Mac from it requires an Mavericks or one of the older versions like

17
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,680
line or something.

18
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,460
That's OK there's still an option known as Doc or tool box which is sort of the legacy.

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,220
It was actually the only version of Dr We could use on a Mac.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,660
Up until mid 2016 when they created Docker for Mac.

21
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,030
So Dr. toolbox is still supported still get the latest versions of Doc are in it.

22
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,630
It's just not going to have all of the nice little extra features and performance benefits of doc or

23
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,380
for Mac.

24
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,950
Other options for using Docker on your Mac include just installing it in a Linux VM.

25
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:56,330
I mean however you want to create a VM do that whether it's locally with virtual box or VMWare Fusion

26
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,170
or Parallels or installing it on a Linux VM on the Internet on the cloud.

27
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,840
You know right on us or Azure or Digital Ocean.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,420
So wherever you can get a Linux VM installed you just can install Dagar on that and you can do 98 percent

29
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,800
of this course that way.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,690
Other options include actually installing Docker in a Windows VM on your Mac.

31
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,810
That might sound kind of weird.

32
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,130
It's like too many layers of stuff going on right and actually that requires something called nested

33
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,450
virtualization.

34
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,820
So I don't really recommend it.

35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,550
I won't support it in this course really I won't talk about it.

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,190
It is possible to make it work in case you for some reason just want to run DR on a Windows machine

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,690
on your Mac.

38
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,730
I personally just do that for testing and demo purposes but if you want to do that it works with VM

39
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,990
or fusion.

40
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:54,230
It does require a little special setting for nested virtualization which means virtualization inside

41
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,350
of virtualization.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,750
So you've got to get that working.

43
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,030
But I'm told by the doctor team that it does work and the last little option here or tidbit I guess

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
is that don't use homebrew to install Docker.

45
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,120
If you've actually already done that you need to uninstall that doctor because what that is is the command

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,990
line only.

47
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,010
It's not going to actually have the Docker server or any of the other features that Docker comes with.

48
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,190
It's only going to have the Docker command line tool and that's useful if you want to use Docker to

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,990
talk to a server remotely.

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,510
But we're not going to do a whole lot of that in this course.

51
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,410
We're going to focus on using Dr on your machine.

52
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,790
So the setup process is going to basically go like this.

53
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,720
In this lecture we're going to actually install Docker and then check out some of the settings or preferences

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,460
for Doc or for Mac and tweak does a little bit and then we're going to download my get up repo that

55
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,100
you're going to need in this course.

56
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,470
With all of the code samples and stuff then we're going to talk about code editors and I prefer a specific

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,750
one visual studio code just because it works really well with Docker.

58
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,290
But just about any one will work whatever favorite one you use will work fine.

59
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,670
And then we're going to show some optional things where maybe you want to tweak your terminal or your

60
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,700
shell set up in your Mac so that it works easier from the command line if you're going to be doing or

61
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,930
stuff all day long.

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,720
OK so let's get started with the install.

63
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:35,020
So go to store dot dot dot dot com as you can see I'm already there and everything in this course is

64
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,970
focused on the free version or the Docker community edition Ducker S.E.

65
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,100
So when this interface changes because all interfaces changes on the web right you're going to have

66
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,070
to find the D'Agostini download area and you'll see that there is an addition for all sorts of different

67
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:59,970
Wes's and we're going to look for the Mac one which happens to be at the top and over here on the right.

68
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,540
I had this get download now you can just click this but you'll notice that.

69
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,670
Also if you're if you're an older version of Mac it'll tell you hey the backup option is Takhar tool

70
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,610
box.

71
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:16,470
But if we scroll down a little bit we get two options and I'm going to use the edge version.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:23,320
The edge is kind of like a beta and I'm of course a tester so I like testing the software and I'd prefer

73
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,690
to see the new features first but I find edge actually to be quite stable.

74
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,160
And with this product only being like a year old I actually find that it gets the things I need the

75
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,430
new features or bug fixes faster as well so I don't know.

76
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,550
Your experience may vary and so generally I tell people if you're in an enterprise environment and you're

77
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,500
looking to have your whole team on exactly the same version that you have in production and to sort

78
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,100
of match all that up then I'd say that stick was stable for everyone else.

79
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,170
I say give em a shot and if at any time you want to change these two it's actually super easy in the

80
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,670
interface to change.

81
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,930
Built in from stable back to edge and back and forth.

82
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,020
So I'm going to do the edge and we're going to run that DMG file

83
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,880
and it should open up a screen that allows you to drag the Docker app into your applications folder

84
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:24,660
like a typical Mac would and it'll copy that over and allow you to run it and close this window.

85
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,290
You can actually close the web browser and go launched Docker.

86
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,810
Now the first time you run it it'll give you this warning just simply because you're downloading it

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,090
over the Internet and not from the Apple store.

88
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,630
So go ahead and click open but you won't get that after that.

89
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,420
Now we're going to walk through the setup process.

90
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,880
It's really easy.

91
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,680
We're just going to click next and it's going to ask us for root privileges and then we're going to

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,310
get a nice set up menu and one of the options is you can sign in and create a Docker I.D. It actually

93
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,850
gives you some neat cloud services that we'll talk later in this course.

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,780
But you don't have to do that right now.

95
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,250
That's not a requirement.

96
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,480
We're just going to wait for it to start and you'll see what a top it says Docker is now running.

97
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,750
And you'll notice that it gives me a menu bar icons so I can get lots of options from here including

98
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,450
everything from checking for updates to restarting Docker, to exiting Docker, and by default this thing

99
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:16,980
will start.

100
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,190
Every time your computer starts when you log in and away we go.

101
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,920
So before we go any further I want to talk about a few preferences that you might want to change.

102
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,660
One of them is I mentioned the option of switching between the edge and the stable versions in case

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,770
maybe you ever have an issue with edge.

104
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:41,630
You can actually do that here and it will sort of remove your Docker VM and then create a new one but

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,820
so you don't want to do this every day but in case you have a bug and you think maybe there's something

106
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,970
to do with the edge version you can always switch back to stable.

107
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:56,970
Second thing is whenever you're working with code that's on your host machine and you want to work with

108
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,180
it in a Docker container.

109
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,880
This is known as bind mounting.

110
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,730
We'll talk a lot about that later.

111
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,300
But for now just remember that when we get to that section you need to make sure that your code whatever

112
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,440
you're going to use is in one of these volumes or one of these directories on your Mac I should say.

113
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,880
And so really for me I just make sure that my code is inside my user directories and for me that slash

114
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,040
users slash Bret.

115
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,580
And for you it's your probably your user name after the users and so you notice that that's already

116
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,270
in here.

117
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,910
But if you're a someone who makes a custom root directory on your Mac you're going to need to add that

118
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,380
in here with the plus symbol.

119
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,830
Docker is actually on a Mac running a tiny VM in the background.

120
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:46,300
It's running a tiny Linux VM and that's because Docker doesn't run natively on the Mac kernel.

121
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,850
Apple hasn't actually built in Docker functionality into its OS kernel so we have to run this tiny

122
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,890
little VM.

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,490
And if you've ever run any virtualization you know that it can give it however many C-p use and however

124
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:06,790
much RAM and I normally leave mine at the to C-p use of the for my laptop and then I usually ramp my

125
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,540
RAM up to like let's say for.

126
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,100
You don't have to do that.

127
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,960
It all depends on how much memory is in your system.

128
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,670
I happen to have 16 gig of RAM on my Mac so I have plenty of room to give it more access in Mac or in

129
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,770
the Docker preferences.

130
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:29,410
Do note though that Docker won't actually take up all of that RAM unless it needs it.

131
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,600
So it's nice and conservative.

132
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,430
That's the same thing with the space too.

133
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,680
On the hard drive it won't take up a huge amount of space it will only grow as it needs to.

134
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,380
And so just because you're giving it for a gig bigger RAM doesn't mean that it's not able to share that

135
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,050
ram with other applications on your Mac.

136
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,770
It just means that Docker can use up to 4 gig of memory and my computer and over here I have to click

137
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,280
Apply and restart.

138
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,110
Now that I've made that change and there's lots of other options you can look at here and read about

139
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,910
and actually see the help on inside the menu.

140
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,550
But for now let's just get into the command line.

141
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,960
So I'm going to bring up the terminal.

142
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,500
It's actually called terminal it's the Mac application and if you're familiar with this you may have

143
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,720
all your own set up.

144
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:22,030
If you're not familiar with terminal it is like power shell or command prompt and windows and like a

145
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,780
standard Linux shell and Linux and it actually is by default.

146
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:31,870
Runs bash which is just a standard shell very common and you can see that it's here the top and I can

147
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,580
actually run Docker version here.

148
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,940
To know that my doctor is running.

149
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,170
And which version of Docker I've got running here so you can see the client and the server are both

150
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,040
listed and we'll talk in the next lecture after the section about what all that stuff means but this

151
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:54,570
basically getting this back does mean that your doctor is working and you can talk to it.

152
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,870
So now that we know that Docker is installed and working correctly let's clone my repository for this

153
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:08,280
course and if you're used to get and get hub then this is a super easy part that you probably have done.

154
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,860
Lots of times in your career.

155
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,900
Probably just this week and it's no big deal.

156
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,050
But if you're new to get or specifically to get hub then let me just drop you through a couple of quick

157
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,340
steps on the easiest way to get my repository downloaded.

158
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,810
So in a previous lecture in this section I gave you some information about where to find my repository

159
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,430
and the link to it.

160
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,250
It's a good dot com slash Bret Fisher slash you to me dasht auger Dasch mastery.

161
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,290
That's a lot to type.

162
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:45,020
So check out the previous lecture on cloning the class repository and that'll get you to this directory

163
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,060
and write in here is basically you can actually view it on the web but we need the whole thing on our

164
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,060
local computer so you would normally on get hub come over here to the clone and download area and I

165
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,280
don't recommend you download the zip.

166
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,920
The reason is is that this course is fluid right.

167
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,860
Tucker is always changing they're always updating and so this course will be as well and you actually

168
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,860
notice even on this page on this it like something changed.

169
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:16,340
Less than a month ago something changed two months ago so things are fluid and if you download a zip

170
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,920
it's not easy to update it once you're in the course.

171
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,760
But if you open it in the desktop it'll actually open it in the get hub gooey and let you keep it in

172
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,210
sync.

173
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:32,420
Doing a get pull on occasion and get hub now has a new desktop and once you've downloaded installed

174
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,860
that you can actually jump back over my repository and use several different options.

175
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,550
You can click the open and desktop which will open it in the gooey for get hub or you can copy the link

176
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,170
and manually paste it into this gooey and then you can put it on your local machine.

177
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,210
The one important part here is that you want to make sure that you're putting it inside your user directories

178
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:03,240
so slash users slash Brett is my user directory on my Mac and I just have a default standard.

179
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,430
I put everything inside a code directory.

180
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,850
The settings for Doc are as we mentioned previously one to make sure that you have all the location

181
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,410
on your hard drive where you might put code that is going to be used inside a container.

182
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,610
I won't cover that all again but if you make sure that it's in your side your user directory then you're

183
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,640
good to go.

184
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:26,270
Once you've downloaded it I would probably do a get pull once a month or so while you're still working

185
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,670
on the course to make sure that you have all the latest fixes and updates as this course evolves.

186
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,060
And while we're on the topic of this terminal this terminal works great.

187
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,430
You can use it your whole career there are lots of people that's been all day long in this particular

188
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,860
terminal application.

189
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,250
But in this course you'll see me use one with a few more features known as i term to.

190
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,520
And you can find that at.

191
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,100
I turned to dot.

192
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,440
It's actually open source and free.

193
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,050
And I actually donate money to them because I use it so often.

194
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,510
And there's one gentleman that actually develops it and I really like it.

195
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,780
So from here you're going to click the download and install it just like you would every other Mac application

196
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,730
and you can see that I have it here running on the right and then I have the terminal actually running

197
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:22,700
on the left and I can do a version on this right side.

198
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,240
And really honestly the only thing that I have different on my I turn to versus the standard terminal

199
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,430
is I've customized it.

200
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,020
I've changed the colors.

201
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,160
I've changed the shell and the options in there.

202
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,050
You can actually find more out about that at Brett Fisher Dotcom's shell.

203
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,010
That'll come at the end of this lecture I'll mention that again so you know where to go find it.

204
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,770
But there's lots of little things and tweaks and stuff I do that you can go get.

205
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,970
And as a reminder none of that is required for this course.

206
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,110
You can use a default terminal and the default Selye just like this or the entire course and it'll work

207
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,740
just fine.

208
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,010
And the next little tip I want to give you is to check out a visual studio code.

209
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,340
So if you don't have a preferred editor you can check out visual studio code.

210
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:14,060
It's actually a free version of a code editor from Microsoft that's very similar to Adam from get help

211
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,300
if you ever use that.

212
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,980
But it actually comes out of a box with a lot more functionality.

213
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:25,780
And one of the nice things is it has a darker feature that you can actually download as an extension.

214
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,070
So you'll see that I have downloaded and installed it already.

215
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,010
And under this button on the left there's an extension's option and you can see that I have some basics

216
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,680
like a spell-checker.

217
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,510
The darker one which is actually really handy in this course it helps you with darker files and compose

218
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,970
files that you will learn about and it gives you syntax highlighting and you'll see that commonly throughout

219
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,460
this course and I actually have a few other ones in there four different languages and tools but really

220
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,790
just the doctor one is the one that I recommend for this course.

221
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,980
And so the last little thing we're going to go through is actually the command tab completion.

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,350
So I'm going to bring up a new tab and I'll give you the link in the end of this lecture and also in

223
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,370
the resources for this lecture.

224
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:22,020
But Docker has some great documentation on how to get the Basche completion weren't working and what

225
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:29,490
that really looks like is when I'm in a shell and we make this a little bigger for you and I start typing

226
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:41,030
a doc or come in Docker container I get if I hit tab I get the options of what I can type and it helps

227
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:49,210
me complete Docker commands so I can do something like this and hit tab again and I get a bunch of options.

228
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,870
So you can do this on your system too.

229
00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:01,430
And all we can do that real quick simply by copying this after we do a few things and all the instructions

230
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,120
are here.

231
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,890
So the first thing is it says to use homebrew Well what is homebrew if you're not familiar with homebrew.

232
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,480
It's actually a another tool.

233
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,960
And this by the way again all optional.

234
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:19,220
You can download it from the homebrew Web site which is brewed at SH and what it is is a command line

235
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,190
tool that helps you install open source command line utilities with a one liner.

236
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,550
It's very similar to apt get on Linux power shell also has one on Windows but basically once you have

237
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,770
it installed you can just type Brue install something and it and it will go get that.

238
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:43,120
So in this case what they're saying is that you need to make sure you have the bash completion.

239
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,040
So let's go through that real quick.

240
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:53,930
So first install homebrew using this command line right here which I already have on my machine but

241
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:00,230
it will install the homebrew application and then from that terminal window meaning large for you you

242
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,170
can actually type Brou install Bash completion.

243
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:12,720
And when I do that it's actually going to download the bash completion and automatically set it up on

244
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,740
my machine.

245
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,790
Now I already have that installed.

246
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,170
So when I hit Enter it's actually going to just tell me that it's already there but for you it will

247
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,840
actually install the best completion and set it up so that you're good to go.

248
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,080
Yeah it says it's already installed when it clear my screen here.

249
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:38,140
And then the next step is to actually link these three resources into your terminals.

250
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,390
So I'm just going to copy and paste that.

251
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,230
And those three lines will make permanent links so that way when I type.

252
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:54,310
Now Doctor container run dash dash and hit tab you'll see that it gives me all the options again and

253
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,770
I can also start from the very beginning and just type Docker and hit tab twice to get all the options

254
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,930
here or I can type part of one and hit tab and automake and complete it for me.

255
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,900
So basically I'm hitting tab all the time.

256
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,110
Right.

257
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,820
And that's known as tab completion.

258
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,660
It works out of the box in a lot of Linux distributions but that's how you get it set up on Docker.

259
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,570
I brought that into this lecture because a lot of people originally were asking me how to get that working

260
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,100
and the doctor's documentation is pretty good on getting that started.

261
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,160
OK.

262
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:30,290
To sum up this lecture Let's cover a few of the tips that I just talked about and also give you a couple

263
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,350
of extra ones before we get started.

264
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,850
So the command completion for your shell is totally optional but it will help you.

265
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,560
This link will actually be in the top left of your screen under the resources and then you can jump

266
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,150
over to the doctor documentation for that.

267
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:51,250
We talked about where to store your code for the samples and the work you're going to be doing in Dakar.

268
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,440
I recommend just sticking it inside slash users slash your user name on your Mac.

269
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,020
That's the easiest place to do it.

270
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,820
But if you do it somewhere else you have to change the settings.

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,730
And when you do that we're going to get into the bind mount thing later but just realize that you probably

272
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,850
shouldn't use the bind mounts for databases really just use it for software code.

273
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,570
That's really what it's meant for.

274
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,420
And it works the best with.

275
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,090
Next one is we didn't talk about this at all.

276
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:26,210
We will later in the course Docker machine allows you to create virtual machines on the fly with Docker

277
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:32,000
built into them and you can use that to create machines and manage them very easily either locally on

278
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,350
your Mac with something like virtual box or even on the Internet with Azure or digital ocean.

279
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,240
So do check that out if you're interested in that.

280
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,220
It's not required for this course but it is yet another way that you can use Docker and manage it pretty

281
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,870
quickly.

282
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,980
We talked about the code editor for this course.

283
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,760
I'm going to be using Visual Studio code a lot.

284
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,560
I will also sometimes use them but you can use whatever you want.

285
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,520
There is no requirement for anything specific.

286
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,720
It's really just text files.

287
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,910
We're gonna be editing and then we talked about I turned to as a potential replacement for terminal.

288
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,360
I know lots of people that are professionals that use Terminal all day long.

289
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,590
They're fine with it.

290
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,470
I just happen to like some of the features in term too.

291
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,800
And so hopefully you will too.

292
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,830
It's open source and it's great stuff.

293
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:27,230
And if you have any problems with your installation definitely check out the docs at doggers Web site.

294
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,810
That link is fantastic.

295
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,700
There is so much information there.

296
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,170
I personally recommend you just read it eventually because you'll learn more things about your doctor

297
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,830
install on your Mac and how the Mac works with it.

298
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,880
And lastly my specific shell set up that I'm going to be using in this course happens to be the I term

299
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,120
two plus not using the bash shell it's something called Oh My Zep's H.

300
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,680
And then I have a lot of other things.

301
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,850
I change the colors.

302
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,130
I have a little whale emoji in there.

303
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,150
I do lots of stuff right but that's not going to distract you from the course like don't think that

304
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,110
you have to have all those things set up.

305
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,940
But I do get a lot of questions from people on how my cool little shell is set up and I do spend an

306
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,310
obsessive amount of time trying to figure that thing out and make it perfect.

307
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,190
So do check out if you're interested in any of those add ons.

308
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:21,940
Brett Fisher dot com slash shell I do list everything that I currently use in my shell setup in there

309
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,430
and someday I might make a full video on how to set each one of those up.

310
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,550
But for now it's really just a list of links and information about them OK.

311
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,740
I hope you got Docker from X set up the just the way you want it and it's working great.

312
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:42,270
If you have to use doc or tool box for the legacy option on Mac do check out the lecture on Docker tool

313
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,980
box for Windows.

314
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:50,490
I know it's not Mac obviously but the tool box works the same way on Windows and on Macs so that lecture

315
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,070
will actually teach you how to use the toolbox.

316
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,090
If you have to but if you don't have to highly recommend the Duggar for Mac get it all set up at the

317
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,050
terminal working and then jump to the next section to get started right now with Dr..

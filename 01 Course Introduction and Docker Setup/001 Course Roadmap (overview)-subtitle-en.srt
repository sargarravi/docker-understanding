Hey Docker Fans! This course roadmap will talk about what you'll be learning and doing in the course sections.

1
00:11.420 --> 00:16.730
If you're a beginner, each section builds on the last. Rather than going through the features, we do

2
00:16.730 --> 00:22.700
a lot of scenario-based work where you'll have assignments to use Docker as maybe a developer would or an operator

3
00:22.820 --> 00:24.880
or maybe a tech support troubleshooter.

4
00:24.890 --> 00:30.200
So you can better understand the "Why" of specific Docker features. If you're beyond the basics,

5
00:30.890 --> 00:35.510
I encourage you to look for lectures around the issues you're trying to solve right now; and, then

6
00:35.510 --> 00:40.730
later, you should review topics you're familiar with that might teach you some tricks or best practices

7
00:40.730 --> 00:42.370
that I sprinkle in along the way.

8
00:43.930 --> 00:49.810
The first section is about getting Docker installed and what to do if you can't actually use Docker locally.

9
00:49.810 --> 00:54.810
Then we go through other tools like text editors and terminal tools that make Docker easier to use.

10
00:55.060 --> 00:59.830
We also talk about the GitHub repository for this course that you'll need to make sure you download

11
00:59.830 --> 01:05.320
before you get started. The next section is where you get to start using the basics of

12
01:05.320 --> 01:06.430
understanding containers.

13
01:06.430 --> 01:12.220
We learn how to manage, create, destroy containers, how they're totally not like a VM.

14
01:12.220 --> 01:14.260
They're actually more like a process.

15
01:14.380 --> 01:19.450
You'll get to create a shell connection into containers and understand what's going on inside them and

16
01:19.450 --> 01:22.720
then you'll learn the basics of Docker networking on your local machine.

17
01:24.830 --> 01:30.530
After that, in the next section, you'll learn the ins and outs of images and how to download and use them

18
01:30.530 --> 01:36.500
from Docker Hub. How to create Docker file recipes, You'll customize and upload images back to

19
01:36.500 --> 01:37.050
Docker Hub.

20
01:37.220 --> 01:45.470
You'll practice running Docker builds and you'll extend official images with your own tweaks. The section

21
01:45.470 --> 01:50.150
after that is where you get to learn some of the options for dealing with persistent data, which is that

22
01:50.180 --> 01:53.590
kind of data you need to keep around and protect like databases.

23
01:53.840 --> 01:58.310
You'll need to understand the lifetime of a container so we'll go through that and how best to design

24
01:58.310 --> 02:01.050
your container solution for easier data management.

25
02:01.310 --> 02:04.580
What Docker volumes are and how you should use them, is in there.

26
02:04.580 --> 02:10.310
And then we talk about bind mounting and how to use Docker for local development.

27
02:10.400 --> 02:15.110
Then I have a section where I go beyond dealing with a single container and you learn Docker Compose

28
02:15.110 --> 02:17.270
for multi-container automation.

29
02:17.270 --> 02:23.660
You'll learn when and when not to use Compose, how to design Compose files, and how to build images and

30
02:23.660 --> 02:31.230
edit code easily with Compose. The next section is a big one where you put your ops hat on and you build

31
02:31.260 --> 02:32.730
a Docker Swarm.

32
02:32.730 --> 02:38.940
You'll see how easy it is to build a three node swarm cluster and you'll learn about networking overlay

33
02:39.040 --> 02:45.150
multi-host networking, and how the routing mesh works for routing packets coming into your network; and,

34
02:45.150 --> 02:49.160
then you'll create some Swarm services for high availability containers.

35
02:49.440 --> 02:53.900
Then you'll create Stacks or production grade compose files deploys. Next,

36
02:54.120 --> 02:59.940
you'll actually improve security by moving your config values into Secrets and how to deploy those Secrets

37
02:59.970 --> 03:01.230
into your Swarm.

38
03:01.380 --> 03:07.410
And finally you'll get to see an example of how to use Compose files for a full app lifecycle including

39
03:07.410 --> 03:15.340
local development, C.I. testing, and deployment to a production Swarm, all with one set of Compose.

40
03:15.370 --> 03:21.340
I'm excited for you to get started and remember to reach out anytime in the Q & A via the Udemy messages

41
03:21.580 --> 03:24.190
or via the private Slack Team that the course comes with.

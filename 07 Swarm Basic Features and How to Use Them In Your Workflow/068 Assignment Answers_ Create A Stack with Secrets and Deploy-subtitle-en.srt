1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,800
This is me walking through the assignment for the secrets compose file that we're going to put

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,600
in our swarm stack.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,070
This file was left over from our previous assignment when we were dealing with Drupal.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,910
That was under a compose assignment 2 directory.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,040
Now I'm up at the top here, and I know we covered this previously but I didn't mention it in the slide,

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,890
is that this version needs to be 3.1.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:38,980
Because a stack and swarm will not accept any secrets in a file unless it's at minimum 3.1

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,090
compose format.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,730
The worst case, though, is if I left it at the 2 and I forgot, when I try to deploy my stack, it'll

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,440
just say, 'Sorry, cannot use compose version 2 file.' So, it'll just be pretty obvious that you need to change

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,810
it.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,910
All right. The next one was, I needed to change this image. We're not going to build a custom image

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,260
on our stack because, remember, swarm doesn't build.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,480
At least not in the current version.

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:14,270
We're going to...um...go back to the official Drupal, 8.2, because in production, we should always pin our versions.

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,820
I'm going to just get rid of this build here. Technically, in a stack,

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,780
I can leave the build command here, but it'll just ignore it.

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,070
I'll actually just tell us, 'Hey. Don't need this build.

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,710
I'm not going to use the build. I'm going to just pull down the image.

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,580
Thank you.'

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,030
We could just leave it, but I'm going to, for this example, not be distracted by that thing and just

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:43,910
delete that line. Then I'm going to go down here to the environment, and we need to change this because

23
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,830
we're no longer going to use an actual password. We're going to use the file.

24
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,930
Then this is so this postges is just like the previous lectures where we talked about how the official

25
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,710
images now have this option for the file to support secrets.

26
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,980
Now I just have to give it the location of the file instead of the actual secret itself.

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:08,630
So, run secrets and we're going to call this one psql pw.

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,240
And then I need to actually specify the secret.

29
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:21,980
So, down here, under secrets, I want to call it psql pw. Then it's going to be external, which means

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,710
that we're creating it on our own from the command line and that it's not the stack's responsibility to

31
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,350
create it.

32
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,910
This is actually just a boolean value.

33
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,890
So, I specify that as true.

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,660
Oh, and then I almost forgot. I go up here,

35
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,140
I've got to add the secrets. I have to list it.

36
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:42,740
All right.

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,980
That looks good to me.

38
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:51,350
We're going to copy this over to the server on node1 of our swarm, and then we'll give the stack

39
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,340
a shot.

40
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,260
OK.

41
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:59,650
I have copied over the compose file from my local machine, so we should be able to do a docker

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:09,650
stack deploy now, -c docker compose, and I'm going to call it drupal.

43
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,690
And that's what happens when you forget to create the secret first.

44
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:22,030
So, just like the instructions said, I'm going to create the secret, and I'm going to just put some random

45
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,370
characters in here.

46
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,650
docker secret create psql pw, pass in the value.

47
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,040
OK.

48
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,370
Now, I should be able to deploy the stack. There we go.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,130
So, docker stack ps drupal.

50
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,860
I've got my postgres and my drupal.

51
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:59,160
So I should be able to bring up a browser and go to node1 8080, and there we go.

52
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,830
I can install a Drupal.

53
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,770
Let's actually test to see if that password worked.

54
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,320
This is not actually required, but I just want to test it anyway.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,300
postgres...postgres...postgres...

56
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,910
Database password...

57
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,450
postgres...there it goes! It worked!

58
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,300
All right.

59
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,120
And we're done.

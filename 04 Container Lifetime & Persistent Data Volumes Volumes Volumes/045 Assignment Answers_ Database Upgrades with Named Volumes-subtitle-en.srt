1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,130
OK.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:12,550
This is me going through the named volumes assignment for updating a database. I know it's supposed

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,360
to be postgres and I'm probably going to need some information from Docker Hub.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,510
Let me switch over to that. OK.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,050
It says I need to start with version 9.6.2.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,020
No, I'm sorry. 9.6.1. I'm supposed to go to 9.6.2. Start with 9.6.1.

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:40,560
I don't see 9.6.1 in here, but I can actually find that over here hopefully in tags. I'm just going

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,770
to search the page for 9.6.1.

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,740
All right.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,760
There we go.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,740
Cool.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,320
Now this is actually a different way

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,350
to look at what the Dockerfile is doing.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,830
I could...it's got a volume path right here.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,220
I'm going to assume that that's the same volume path for both.

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,080
Because they don't change that kind of thing

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,050
very often.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,360
I going to call it 9.

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,280
So, OK. docker container run.

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,510
I don't have to worry about ports or anything.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,720
We don't need ports for this.

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:34,500
I'm going to use a -d to put it in the background. Then I'm just going to name it psql. Then I'm going to call the

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,260
volume psql.

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:44,130
I'm going to paste in that volume to store the data. Then I need to call the container post...

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,060
the image...I need to type the image here.

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:59,020
9.6.1. K. Now, docker container logs

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:19,990
follow..I'm going to do the -f command so that it keeps watching as it runs.

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,450
I think it's actually done booting.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,890
Database system is ready to accept connections.

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,320
OK.

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,450
I'm going to Control c out of that.

32
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,170
So that's good.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:38,110
I'm going to do a docker container stop psql.

34
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:46,380
I going to hit the Up Arrow. I'm going to change this to a 2. I need to change the name to a 2, because

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,430
I can't have two with the same name.

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,650
I'm going to do a docker container

37
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,880
ps -a, I should see

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,270
two different versions. One that stopped a few minutes ago. I do a docker

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
volume

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,560
ls. I can see that I have one volume with that correct name.

41
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,280
If I do a docker container logs

42
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,600
on this one...

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,440
Yeah.

44
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,530
Short, very short logs there.

45
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,720
And database system is ready to accept connections.

46
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,750
I successfully updated.

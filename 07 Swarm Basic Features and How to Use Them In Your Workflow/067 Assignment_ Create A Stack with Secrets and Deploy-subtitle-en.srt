1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,480
Now that you've seen all the ways to create secrets in our stack, I'm going to give you a little

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,610
assignment on using secrets with a previous stack you've used.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,370
You remember our friend Drupal, the compose file we used earlier, in compose assignment 2.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,050
I want you to take that, and we're going to actually extend it and make it stack ready.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,260
First, we're not going to build a custom image right now.

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,880
We're just going to use the default Drupal.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,000
Then you would need to remove the build section from your compose file. Then I'd like you to

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:42,390
add the secret at the bottom, and when you do that, instead of using a file-based secret, put in external.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,170
You can also look that up in the resources for this section.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,750
It'll be the documentation on Docker's website all about secrets.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,420
It'll show you the formatting in there of a compose file. So you use external, which means we actually

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,840
have to use the CLI to put that secret in. Then you're going to pass the password file,

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,930
that is the secret file, into postgres, using the environment variable.

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,290
So, you'll need to add that to the postgres section.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,520
Then before we actually deploy the stack, you need to actually put the secret into the swarm.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,250
This will be a case where we're not using a secret file. We're simply going to manually, as an operator,

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,280
add the secret to our swarm. Then in the stack file,

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,920
we're going to actually specify that, using the external at the bottom.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,570
Once you've got it all edited the way you think it's correct and you're ready to test it, just copy it

20
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,910
into a new YAML file on your swarm node1. Try and do a stack deploy and see if it works.

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,060
You may not get it right the first time, and that's fine.

22
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,600
A lot of times I won't either.

23
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,440
I have to go back and revise it, and then try a deployment again. The errors that you'll get back

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,310
are usually pretty good at telling you what your problems are.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,460
For me, it's usually that my YAML isn't formatted correctly or something silly like that.

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,200
If you have any issues, don't hesitate to just watch the video after this where I actually walk through

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,420
this assignment for you.

28
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,750
But I think your brain will work better if you try it yourself and get your mind working about how you

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,880
would actually solve this assignment yourself.

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,700
Good luck, and I'll see in the next lecture.

            <p>So you've maybe heardabout "Windows Containers". Something that wasn't even possible till mid-2016 in Windows 10 Pro/Entand not feasible in production with Docker Swarm until April 2017 with a Windows Server 2016 hotfix. <strong>They are awesome, but super new!</strong></p>

<p><strong>To be clear, this course so far, even on Windows, is running what we've known as "Docker"for 4 years, which are now called "Linux Containers".</strong></p>

<p>Today Docker is much more than Linux. When you think of images, which are kernel specific, we're now talking about Linux x64, Linux x86 (32-bit), Windows 64bit, and a bunch more. <strong>This course still largely focuses on Linux x64 images because 90% of the concepts are the same</strong>, but "Windows Containers"are the new hotness! Technically, they areNative Windows .exe binaries running in Docker containers on a Windows kernel, and have no Linux installed.</p>

<p>If you check the course Description, Imention at bottom in "Course Launch Notes" about Windows Containers as a future Section Iplan to add. When making this course in early 2017, Ididn't know anyone really using them because Swarm Overlay networking didn't work on Windows, Secrets didn't work yet, and there were lots of rough edges that people wouldn't find very useful.</p>

<p><strong>Butwith the release of 17.06 stable, the story for Windows Containers is much better and Iplan on a new section this year.</strong> Until then, here's some recentgetting started videos from Docker and Microsoft:</p>

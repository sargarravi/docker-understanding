0
00:02.260 --> 00:05.240
OK.

1
00:05.260 --> 00:11.050
This is a lesson where I'm going to walk through the assignment for the CLI app testing and you can see

2
00:11.050 --> 00:14.970
my thought process as I just sort of talk out loud while I do it.

3
00:15.460 --> 00:15.760
OK.

4
00:15.760 --> 00:24.590
So, I need to start two Linux distributions. We're going to use the rm, so docker container run rm.

5
00:25.650 --> 00:30.170
Let's see...I'm not going to want to run it as a daemon.

6
00:31.510 --> 00:33.530
I am going to want to use i t

7
00:37.280 --> 00:39.750
cent os 7.

8
00:39.920 --> 00:44.360
I don't need a port open but I do need to get bash.

9
00:46.890 --> 00:53.640
OK. Then I going to need to do yum update curl.

10
00:53.780 --> 01:03.860
And then while that's going, I'm in iTerm2 and iTerm2 is my terminal command.  So command shift d

11
01:03.870 --> 01:08.460
will give me another window... another shell

12
01:11.510 --> 01:18.520
so I can then do docker container run rm

13
01:19.170 --> 01:36.380
it ubuntu 14.04 bash and then do an apt get update then apt get install curl. I'm actually going to throw

14
01:36.380 --> 01:38.300
in a -y so it automatically does it.

15
01:41.220 --> 01:45.770
Then up here, I can do a curl version while that one is going. All right.

16
01:45.770 --> 01:49.880
And it's got curl version 7.2 9 installed.

17
01:50.270 --> 01:51.780
And then ubuntu.

18
01:52.640 --> 01:55.100
All right curl version.

19
01:55.900 --> 02:05.910
All right and ubuntu is 7. 35. I just happen to know that CentOS tends to lag behind in

20
02:05.910 --> 02:12.410
some more enterprise-y Linux distributions so it tends to have older packet package versions than

21
02:12.410 --> 02:17.410
Ubuntu even though we're actually running a Ubuntu version that's more than a few years old.

22
02:18.750 --> 02:19.190
OK.

23
02:19.310 --> 02:23.380
So when I type exit I shouldn't see my container in there anymore.

24
02:24.410 --> 02:30.080
No. And then appear if I type exit and I do another listing,

25
02:33.210 --> 02:39.920
you'll see that one thing left is an nginx container I had left over from my previous unrelated session.

26
02:39.980 --> 02:42.200
So my CentOS disappeared.

27
02:42.370 --> 02:46.550
And my Ubuntu disappeared, which is what the --rm does for us.

28
02:46.550 --> 02:46.880
All right.

29
02:46.880 --> 02:48.390
And that's it.

30
02:48.450 --> 02:49.440
Nothing to clean up.

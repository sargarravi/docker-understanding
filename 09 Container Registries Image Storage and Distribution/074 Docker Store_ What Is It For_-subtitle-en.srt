So what about the store? And what makes it different from Hub?

1
00:08.790 --> 00:13.680
Docker Hub has been around for years, and is the place where we've been going throughout this course.

2
00:13.900 --> 00:17.470
The Docker Store was released in the summer of 2016.

3
00:17.490 --> 00:20.870
At first, it didn't have a whole lot for us to care about.

4
00:20.970 --> 00:26.120
Since then, it's been continually evolving to be the place where we get more and more of this stuff.

5
00:26.370 --> 00:31.730
As of today, in spring of 2017, I can tell you that the Docker Store is really for two things.

6
00:31.740 --> 00:34.100
One, is for actual Docker software.

7
00:34.140 --> 00:35.750
They've moved all their downloads here.

8
00:35.760 --> 00:40.590
There's so many editions of Docker now with all the different cloud options and downloads that

9
00:40.590 --> 00:42.500
we have for our local installations.

10
00:42.530 --> 00:45.040
Any time you want to download Docker it forwards you to here.

11
00:45.150 --> 00:52.530
And secondly, it's giving you a higher level of assurance about software from third parties. That software

12
00:52.530 --> 01:02.520
might be images from Microsoft, or that might be software that's a add-on to Docker or a plugin.

13
01:02.590 --> 01:03.960
Let's see some examples.

14
01:03.970 --> 01:10.720
These are going to be listed images that are placed here by the creators. In this case we're seeing

15
01:10.720 --> 01:15.610
Microsoft images, and with the little checkbox, theyâ€™re Docker certified.

16
01:15.610 --> 01:20.470
This just indicates that Docker and Microsoft have worked together on this image to ensure that it

17
01:20.470 --> 01:25.780
meets all Docker best practices and that it's truly from Microsoft and not someone pretending to be them

18
01:25.780 --> 01:26.680
on Docker Hub.

19
01:26.680 --> 01:32.170
What you won't see on the store is ten different versions of .NET from ten different people that

20
01:32.170 --> 01:34.980
have all built it themselves the way they like it.

21
01:35.020 --> 01:39.640
If I had to tell someone in an elevator pitch the difference between the Docker Store today and Docker

22
01:39.670 --> 01:46.810
Hub, I would say Docker Hub is like the GitHub of images and that Docker Store is like an app store

23
01:46.870 --> 01:51.790
for images. Or, maybe more specifically, the Apple Store for images, because the only way that something

24
01:51.790 --> 01:58.240
gets here is when they partner and work with Docker to get their official software into the store. Over

25
01:58.240 --> 01:58.720
time,

26
01:58.750 --> 02:02.860
I believe what we're going to see is the things here that you could pay for, which is those things that

27
02:02.890 --> 02:08.530
aren't necessarily open-source but maybe some more closed-sourced products from companies. You'll be

28
02:08.530 --> 02:11.450
able to use the store to pay for subscriptions of those.

29
02:11.860 --> 02:13.800
And you can start to see some of that happening today.

30
02:13.810 --> 02:19.570
For instance, if we scroll down and we saw this Microservice Firewall from Polyverse, it's $50 a month

31
02:19.630 --> 02:22.190
for you to have access to this image.

32
02:22.360 --> 02:27.100
So, I guess the word store makes sense here, because it's essentially the place we could potentially pay

33
02:27.100 --> 02:30.600
for images. But that's all I'm really going to go into on the Store.

34
02:30.610 --> 02:32.890
You can check it out on your own. For this course,

35
02:32.890 --> 02:34.980
we're going to spend all of our time in Docker Hub.

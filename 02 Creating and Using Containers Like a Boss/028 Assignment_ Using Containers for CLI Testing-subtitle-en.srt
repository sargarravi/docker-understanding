The requirements for this assignment, or the things you need to know before you should do this assignment,

1
00:11.130 --> 00:18.000
is that you've gone through some of the lectures in the past around getting a command shell inside the

2
00:18.000 --> 00:23.420
container, and also some of the basics around Linux distributions and how they might differ,

3
00:23.550 --> 00:28.840
and of course running a container. OK here's another assignment for you and it's going to be a little

4
00:28.840 --> 00:33.030
different than your traditional developer-meets-container scenario.

5
00:33.130 --> 00:36.000
But it's just as valid and just as common in the real world.

6
00:37.240 --> 00:42.400
In the past you might have set up a whole virtual machine just to simply test something like a different

7
00:42.400 --> 00:45.550
command line version or different Linux distribution.

8
00:45.550 --> 00:48.140
But with containers that gets WAY easier.

9
00:48.190 --> 00:55.830
Imagine yourself being a support engineer for a server farm that runs both Ubuntu and CentOS, and a

10
00:55.860 --> 01:01.540
ticket comes in that asks you to check on the different curl versions in those two distributions.

11
01:01.540 --> 01:08.200
So in the old, pre-container world, you'd probably have to set up a virtual environment and wait for operating

12
01:08.200 --> 01:10.680
systems to install unless you had them ready.

13
01:10.750 --> 01:14.040
But in this world we can actually just run a few commands.

14
01:14.050 --> 01:21.790
So really the goal here is just to run the curl version command inside two different Linux distributions

15
01:22.200 --> 01:23.670
in just a few minutes.

16
01:23.770 --> 01:27.100
So we'll be using the centos:7 version.

17
01:27.130 --> 01:33.410
And then the ubuntu:14.04  version. You'll want to use the -it on your docker run command

18
01:33.650 --> 01:36.480
and give it the bash command at the end.

19
01:37.280 --> 01:41.780
Then there's a new option you should try, which is the --rm, which will save you some time

20
01:41.780 --> 01:46.610
later. So I recommend looking that up through Help on the command line or through the Docker Support

21
01:46.610 --> 01:49.150
site at docs.docker.com.

22
01:49.550 --> 01:51.690
And really once you're in there,...

23
01:51.710 --> 01:56.480
oh and by the way, you definitely want two different terminal windows so you can switch back and forth between

24
01:56.480 --> 01:57.210
these two...

25
01:57.380 --> 02:04.010
and in order to run the curl version command, you're going to need to update each one of the distributions

26
02:04.400 --> 02:07.190
or check whether or not curl's installed.

27
02:07.370 --> 02:12.370
I've given you some commands there that they're a little bit different between the two. Really

28
02:12.370 --> 02:15.760
this exercise isn't going to give you an interesting output.

29
02:15.760 --> 02:22.300
It's really just helping you understand how easy and quick you can jump into different software or Linux

30
02:22.300 --> 02:27.940
distributions, run some tools, and then get out. In the end, I would expect you to have different curl

31
02:27.940 --> 02:29.590
versions in those two distributions.

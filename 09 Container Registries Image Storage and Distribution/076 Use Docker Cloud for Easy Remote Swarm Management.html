            <p>A new feature for Docker Cloud in 2017 is "Swarms", which in part, allows you to use Cloud as a way to connect your local Docker CLI to a remote Swarm you've created anywhere that has Internet access (no inbound ports needed).</p>

<p>This means you can use your local shell to control a remote swarm cluster with docker commands, without needing SSH access to that server. It also means you can give other people secure access to a swarm via Cloud, without them also needing SSH, and then later revoke their access in Cloud. </p>

<p>It's not a full RBAC solution like Docker Enterprise Edition provides, but it's better than what we get out of the box with Docker CE!</p>

<p>For now, it works best when using "Docker for Mac" and "Docker for Windows" GUI's, which if you log into them with your Docker ID, you'll see a list of Swarms that you can setup via Docker Cloud.</p>

<p>The way this works is, when you follow the steps in Docker's setup video below, it'll install a "Cloud Agent" container in your Swarm, that allows Cloud to act as a sort of proxy between your local Docker CLI and your remote Swarm.</p>

1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,400
All right you're a Windows user and you want to get Docker working.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,700
So let's get you to it in this lecture.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,710
You're going to learn the two types of containers that can now run on Windows.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,450
You're going to get through which dog addition you want to install based on your version of windows

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:28,070
in your edition of Windows you're also going to learn the difference between Windows 10 and server 2016

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,440
and how the desktop and server treat are a little bit differently.

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,900
And then the next lecture is going to get to installing it.

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,580
There are two types of containers.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,780
Now on Windows which is really cool we have the options now for Linux containers or.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,970
Up until recently we just called them containers because that was the only type of container we had.

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,100
Now we have windows containers.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,400
Now this course by default is actually going to talk about Linux containers because we've had those

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,890
for four plus years and that's everything that we all know about containers was Linux based.

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,460
It was only till late 2016 that Microsoft really formalized the concept of a Windows container and made

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,300
it usable and they're rapidly innovating.

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,720
So it's a pretty exciting space.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,480
But most of the concepts are the same.

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,000
You're going to use them the same way you're going to manage them the same way.

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,260
It just matters that buying areas that are running inside them you know SQL X-C vs. MySQL

20
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,580
on Linux or something.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,740
So we'll going to talk in this course about containers when I say that I really mean Linux containers

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,350
when I talk about specifically on Windows containers.

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,960
I will say Windows containers so that we're clear.

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,680
OK.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,260
And the best version of Docker on Windows is Docker for Windows.

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,800
That's actually an edition of Docker and it's got a whole install that we're seeing a moment and it's

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,480
really great on Windows 10.

28
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,680
It only works on pro and enterprise.

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,970
Unfortunately if you had the home version of Windows 10 or an older version of Windows it's not going

30
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,960
to work.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,870
In those cases you're going to use the or tool box which was the only option we had until a year ago

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
so it's still a great option.

33
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,380
It's still updated it's still supported.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,820
It's just not going to have all the nice cool features that Docker for Windows has because Windows 10 has

35
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,600
new innovations in it using Hyper-V that we just don't get in those old versions unfortunately.

36
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,500
Windows now with server 2016 it does support Windows containers.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,130
We won't go in a whole lot into that in this course because that's still really new stuff and they're

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,400
making major changes even just three or 4 months ago they added a whole new networking feature set

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,040
to it.

40
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,880
So it's a rapidly evolving ecosystem.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,520
I will continue to update this course and any other courses with all that stuff as well and just as

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,390
an example of what that's like is we had in the spring not only this new networking overlay networking

43
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,340
that we'll get into later in the course but we also have native Linux containers that we haven't even

44
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,860
seen yet.

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,480
But Windows announced it at DockerCon and that basically is some feature we're going to see in the near

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,080
future that supposedly will have Windows intelligently and automatically figuring out when you want

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,390
to run a container whether it should be on Linux or Windows and then do that for you.

48
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,230
Today we have to manually specify they're supposedly going to make some new feature in the future that

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,320
works on that.

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,080
That's something that nobody else is doing.

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,470
No other platform is doing that so it's pretty cool to be on Windows.

52
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,930
It's just evolving rapidly so be prepared.

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,640
So if you're on Windows 10 pro in Enterprise you're one of the lucky few that get to actually run Docker

54
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,050
for Windows and you can get that from stored up.

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:48,370
Docker Delcam it's actually got more features than if you just installed Linux in a Linux VM on your machine.

56
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,190
So if you're tempted to just say screw it I'm just going to install an exe VM and I'm going to install

57
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,070
Linux on it.

58
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:00,330
Well that would work like a server in the cloud like a Linux production server might but the docs for

59
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:07,500
Windows and the Docker toolboxes are really helping you develop and test stuff locally so it does things

60
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,180
like map drives from your host operating system into the container and we'll get to that stuff later.

61
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,440
But it's worth trying.

62
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,980
OK before you go that other route in the background Docker for Windows is actually using Hyper-V which

63
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,410
uses a tiny little Linux VM for the Linux containers.

64
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,270
So if you're on Windows 10 pro or Enterprise right now and you have a virtual box or VM where they may

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:38,670
not work with Hyper-V I know virtual box and Hyper-V don't play well together so you may have to google

66
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,570
around the Internet for solutions on trying to get those to work right.

67
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,190
If you want to use both.

68
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:51,240
Personally I just decide to shift everything in the Hyper-V once Docker shift it into Hyper-V.

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,140
It is power native which means in this course if you're on Docker for Windows I expect you to be using

70
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,190
power shell and I will show you commands on how to do that.

71
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,930
You can get other shells to work if you press shell ninja and you like bash or you like the old command

72
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,740
prompt.

73
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:15,750
That's fine on Docker for Windows 7 8 and 10 home we already use a Docker tool box which is not as fancy

74
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,150
as the Docker for Windows but it's still great.

75
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,300
Still works fine.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,650
You could use it every day.

77
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:26,040
Like others you're going to download that stored at Docker.com and it does run a tiny little Linux

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,220
VM in the background and it uses virtual box and it uses a command line called dock or machine to manage

79
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,210
that virtual box and you'll see that later in the course as well.

80
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,060
If you just want to learn how Docker machine works right now you can actually just go google it and

81
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,180
I'll give you great instructions on how you use or machine command line to create IMs and destroy them.

82
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,950
You can actually create multiple Docker machines if you wanted.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,660
Now in this machine it comes by default with a tool box.

84
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:59,230
It comes with a bash shell called the dock or QuickStart terminal I believe is it's called and that's

85
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,060
what I expect you to use in this course.

86
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,010
That's the one that's going to work the best.

87
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,840
It's going to auto start things and make sure everything's working correctly.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,190
If you're more savvy and you wanted to get into other options for shells I might give you some tips

89
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,300
along the way but I can't really support every shell in every possible configuration for your environment.

90
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,630
So I'm going to focus on how a Docker provides it out of the box.

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,160
Note that those versions of Windows that we're talking about right now do not support the windows containers

92
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,090
they only support the Linux containers in that small little VM.

93
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,770
And lastly just a note about Windows Server 2016 as it is a part of this course and it supports Windows

94
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:46,480
native containers so it runs a Windows binary out of the box without Hyper-V or anything installed in

95
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,620
a doctor container which is pretty cool.

96
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:55,780
It does also support Docker for Windows but Docker for Windows is really a tool kit for local development

97
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,340
and testing.

98
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,100
It's not meant as a production tool.

99
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,250
So the only reason I would tell you to do this is if you had Windows Server installed on your local

100
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,730
machine as a replacement for Windows 10 right.

101
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,650
Some developers do that they developed locally on Windows Server because that's the platform they use

102
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,500
in production and they like to develop on that platform.

103
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,110
So if you're doing that totally install Docker for Windows it'll give you a better experience but if

104
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,230
you're in production don't do that you really want to run Docker Windows containers natively on server

105
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,100
2016.

106
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,640
And if you're going to do Linux containers you run those natively on Linux not on onger for Windows

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,690
in production.

108
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,540
The previous versions of Windows don't really support anything with Docker unless you're talking about

109
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,630
a previous version of Windows that's running Hyper-V and that's running on your bare metal.

110
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,690
And then you just run a Linux VM.

111
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,660
Of course you can do that.

112
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,830
You can do that anywhere anywhere you can run a VM you can put Linux on it and it can run Docker so

113
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,560
that one is definitely still on the table.

114
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,000
If that's the way you want to go.

115
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,530
But in this course I'm not going to expect you to be developing and testing on server 2016.

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,370
I'll assume that you're on Windows 10 or Ubuntu or Mac or something.

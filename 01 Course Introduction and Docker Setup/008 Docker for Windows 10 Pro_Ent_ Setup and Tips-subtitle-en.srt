1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,820
Now we're going to actually get into the real install. First we're going to download install doc

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,840
or we're going to tweak some of the settings of it or check them out at least and then we're going to

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,760
go clone my repo.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,170
We're going to get an editor.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,550
You don't have a code editor.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,680
And then we are checking out a few options if you want to tweak your terminal and your shell set up

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,600
we can get to that to.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,590
So here's my plain old windows Tim Pro machine.

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,690
And the first thing we're going to do is we're going to store it at Docker.com

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:49,570
and I'm going to click on Docker see here in the middle and then Docker Community Edition for Windows.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,610
Now in here you'll notice that by default when I click to get Docker it's going to download the Docker

12
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,520
for Windows.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,650
He says this requires when asked in professional if I had an older version of Windows that will show

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,170
in a few minutes I would click on the dock tool box.

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:08,880
But here I'm going to say get Docker and by the fall by the way this is installing the Stable condition

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,640
not the Edge for one Edge I guess scroll down a little farther and I could choose edge or if I was actually

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,650
on the server version I could actually do the Edge there as well.

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,350
Let's save this.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,260
I personally save it before I run it because it seems to work better that way.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,110
And then we're going to run the install and the install is pretty typical for Windows.

21
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:37,600
It's going to ask me if it's OK now it's installing.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,680
You know it's not running.

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,280
I would see a little Moby icon down there.

24
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,040
So let me actually run it and it's going to ask me about Hyper-V.

25
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:53,110
So if you don't have Hyper-V installed on your machine then this will actually enable it and reboot.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,080
Now that means you have to have local admin.

27
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,800
I mean you had to have local admin to install this thing and you don't have to have local admin for

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,470
Hyper-V.

29
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:06,730
If you're on a laptop or desktop that you've never done virtualization on there there's a rare case

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,800
that you may need to go in the BIOS and actually enable the virtualization features in the BIOS.

31
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,750
And that's well-documented on the internet.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,340
If you have an error I recommend just looking at the error up on the Internet and you'll probably will

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,640
find that everyone saying oh yeah go in your bios and find the extensions and install the VTX extension

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,320
or whatever it is in the BIOS.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,640
You're not actually installing it you're actually just enabling it.

36
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,870
But that's a rare case.

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,350
Most of the time people that have problems installing it's either because they're on a home edition

38
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,880
but they forgot to check and they thought they had pros so they try to install the pro version.

39
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,750
Or maybe they're running an older version of Windows 10 doesn't have the latest updates.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,780
It is important that you keep your windows machine up to date for Docker because Windows is updating

41
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,710
their stuff as rapidly as Dockers updating theirs and they're both related.

42
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,520
So you definitely get to keep those.

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,870
You can actually now see on my machine I've rebooted and Docker is starting in this little icon down

44
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:17,630
at the bottom once it's booted then I'll see this little prompt and I can run my power show as me not

45
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,900
as admin but just as me and I can do a darker version and I should see it running.

46
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,480
And this is the version I have installed this is the latest stable version.

47
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,710
And in case you were so inclined in the background this is running Hyper-V so I can run the Hyper-V

48
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:42,090
desktop app and I can actually see on my desktop that this is running in something called a Moby Linux

49
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:49,620
VM and it's got 2GB of RAM installed and it's uptime is just a minute because it just started so real

50
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:49,920
quick.

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,620
Let's just go into the settings right click on that little icon down there and we'll go up here to settings

52
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,240
and as a couple that you need to care about if you store your code that you might use in this course

53
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,930
on a different drive you need to check that here.

54
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,030
I definitely going to check see because that's where I keep a lot of my code so I need to enable where

55
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,140
ever I'm going to have code running inside a container.

56
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,290
You'll see more about that later.

57
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,520
But you got to do that here.

58
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,680
And the other thing is you might if you want if you have enough resources you can always bump up the

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,750
memory or the C-p use.

60
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,780
I think it comes pretty cool out of the box.

61
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,610
I mean 2GB in two-CD uses a pretty good amount.

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,800
But if you start hitting it limits and starts to get slow you can always bump those up depending on

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,600
your hardware.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,150
Right.

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,200
And the rest of these options you're kind of kind of leave the same probably you're not going to have

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,480
to mess with those too much in this course.

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:51,030
But when I apply these settings it will require restarting of ducker and while that's happening.

68
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,140
Let's go clone my repo.

69
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,030
And remember that this is in the resource lecture earlier in this section.

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,170
Now I'm going to clone this but I want to clone it in desktop.

71
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,150
If you've never use get up before then you can use a GUI.

72
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,650
And that's probably one of the easiest ways that you're not used to get up if you know get how you get

73
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,770
you've got your own way to do it.

74
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:19,360
But here what I can do is I can actually use the GitHub gooey to download and clone my repo.

75
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,900
So I'm going to install that.

76
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,430
All right and then I'm actually going to put all of my code in a directory called code.

77
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,380
So I'm going to make a directory so you'll see on my machine that I actually put all of my software

78
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,800
code inside a directory called code on underneath my user.

79
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,840
So that's where I'm going to clone this from GitHub at.

80
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,800
And if you remember earlier I just changed the settings so that the C-Drive could be where I store some

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,370
code that Docker can see.

82
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,880
So I'm just going to log in as me.

83
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,160
OK.

84
00:05:53,170 --> 00:06:00,850
Now that I have GitHub installed one of the ways I can clone it is from the website I can copy to your

85
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,350
el and then go back over to desktop and say clone repository.

86
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,280
Copy that in and then member I wanted it.

87
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,220
This is not going to be under Documents.

88
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,380
It's going to be under code that's where I put my hands.

89
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:20,370
So clum Now the advantage of doing it this way instead of downloading the zit is that you can come in

90
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:27,090
here and update it because I do update this repo when there's fixes or changes in Docker which happens

91
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,540
pretty pretty much every month.

92
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,210
So now if I do it during Here you can see them in the doctor that to me Docker M.E. directory.

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,260
And there we go.

94
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,520
Now if you're not savvy on code editors a little tip here is the best one.

95
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,310
I like for editing is Visual Studio code.

96
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,150
I can you can just search vs code in the US code and you'll get the Web site coming right up.

97
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:01,350
And then you can download it and install it just like a regular Windows app and it works quite well.

98
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:09,160
One of the best parts about this editor is that it has a built in Docker syntax so it'll let me open

99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,040
up Duck or compose files and Docker files.

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,160
As you'll learn in this course and it will highlight the code in them and give me actual little hints

101
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,440
about how to use it.

102
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,720
And the last little tip here is around a couple of options for your command line.

103
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,950
So if you want to add a Docker documentation you'll see that they have a whole section on setting

104
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,880
up tab completion in power show and tab completion and Power Shell is what we get.

105
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,270
And Linux and Mac out of the box.

106
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,020
So basically it means that when I type the dog or command I can actually hit tab and it will fill out

107
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,710
the information for that common command depending on what I've typed.

108
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,180
And you can see that I don't have it here it just kind of list directories which is not what I want.

109
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,640
I actually wanted to list things like duck or run or other commands.

110
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,460
Well the way you get that widget install this and it's a couple of steps you'll.

111
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,860
You can see both of these will actually give you full steps to get it started and running.

112
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,830
But I'll just show you the quickest way I know how.

113
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:20,410
So we're going to actually install the module per the instructions on the GitHub repo and you'll see

114
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,350
right here.

115
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:32,440
All I have to do is install module with a scope of current user posh Docker and when I do that it's

116
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:41,160
going to actually ask me to install a different option called New get and New get is fine.

117
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,730
It's actually from Microsoft.

118
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,590
It's partly how you install modules on your machine.

119
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,760
So just say yes there and say yes again.

120
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,600
And now that we've installed it we need to actually enable it and we do that with import module posh

121
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:06,880
Docker and if you get an error about your security scripts disabling thing that has what is actually

122
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,580
happening is partially secure by default and it's preventing you from running an Internet script.

123
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:21,320
So what we want to do is if we go over here to the Docker documentation they have a little more information

124
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,650
on how to get this going and what you can do here is you can set an execution policy.

125
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,770
But what that's going to mean is that you're going to have to it's not going actually let you do it

126
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,610
as a non admin.

127
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,980
So what you're gonna have to do is then start power shell as an admin.

128
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:47,750
If you just saw I right click there run that and then in that window I'm going to set my execution policy

129
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,850
to a little less secure.

130
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,160
But it should be fine for remote sign that's pretty reasonable.

131
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:03,560
And then now we should be able over here to try the import module again on this window and there we

132
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,280
go.

133
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,900
Now the way I know it works is when I type in Docker and then I hit tab it gives me Docker commands

134
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,610
here.

135
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,070
So for example if I just typed in Docker help I get a list of all the different command options.

136
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,820
But if I type in Docker and I hit tab it actually starts going through those.

137
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,430
However this module is a little bit limited and it's a little bit dated.

138
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,120
So unfortunately it's the best option we have on Windows for power show command depletion but if you'll

139
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,410
notice it's actually a little dated.

140
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,850
It hasn't had an update in over 6 months.

141
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,450
So with the current command line formats you may not find it extremely valuable.

142
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,080
I did find it better than nothing but there's a long way for it to go it's certainly not as good as

143
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,260
Mac or Linux.

144
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,410
But it is the good thing is it's open source.

145
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,180
So maybe when you have some time and you want to get savvy at power show command completion.

146
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,920
You can go here and help out.

147
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,500
Now I do want to point out that even though we've installed the module for the current user and enabled

148
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,670
it it's not going to automatically start every time unless we add it to our power show profile.

149
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,270
If you didn't know what that was it's actually very similar to a bash profile that profile of a file

150
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,370
or a bash RC file.

151
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,930
Maybe depending on which one you prefer and actually on the darker side it's really nice to give you

152
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:37,000
this little snippet which we'll check to see if you have an existing profile file and create it.

153
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,600
If you don't

154
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,180
and so I didn't have one.

155
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,950
So what it did is it automatically created that profile in my documents directory and then added this

156
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,290
import module posh Docker to it which is pretty cool.

157
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,540
If you start to get into power show you learn that that power profile is actually pretty powerful and

158
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,550
you can do some pretty cool stuff with it and make your power cells set up pretty advanced and fancy

159
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,230
The other option is if you want to replace this window right so this power show window is a terminal

160
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,360
emulator not the same as the shell that's inside it because we still have to use the power shell shell

161
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,050
but we can use is a different gooey for that show.

162
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:32,120
And that might be commander dot net and Commander is basically a console emulator that gives you a huge

163
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,810
amount of features for free open source out of the box.

164
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,860
And the way I install it is I just download it.

165
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:48,260
It's a zip file and I actually make sure that by the way when you do this you right click go to properties

166
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:57,740
and unblock so that you can actually unzip it and then it works doesn't complain to you.

167
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,010
All right.

168
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:05,120
Now that I've extracted the commander I'm going to hear and I'm going to drag the commander button down

169
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,090
here the commander you is actually what that is.

170
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,270
I'm just going to drag that down to my start menu or my task bar rather and that way I can launch it

171
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,830
from here.

172
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,230
And the first time it's going to do some stuff that's going to set up some things.

173
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:25,530
Notice that it's actually got a tab down here and I can create more tabs and I can do that over here.

174
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,510
A dropdown menu is actually several of them here.

175
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,770
This one allows me to decide what my next tab is going to run as is it going to run Bash is going to

176
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,850
run power shell or they're going to run the command prompt.

177
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:45,330
Well I remember I told you earlier we need to run this power show so we're going to be in here and then

178
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:52,080
we're going to type in Docker p.s. and that way we go talker info works and you'll learn about these

179
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,010
commands all in a minute.

180
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,270
But the point is a kind of just works out of the box.

181
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:03,930
If you wanted that posh to always work then what you will you might need to do the posh Docker thing

182
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:12,570
rather you might need to come over here and come up in two settings and then you know you look at this

183
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,600
you're like all the cow there's a whole lot of settings here.

184
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,840
So what you need to do is come down here to startup tasks.

185
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,470
Don't be distracted by everything else.

186
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:28,230
And over here under power shall power shall we need to take out this little option right here that says

187
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,710
no profile.

188
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,830
OK.

189
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,690
Because that will prevent it from loading the profile file we just created.

190
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:41,940
And you can say those settings and then you close the commander and then you started up again.

191
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,910
No set defaults the command by default.

192
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,370
So you can always go in the settings and change that.

193
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:54,290
If I go over here and say power show Power Shell then I get this nice little power shall prompt.

194
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,880
And see that I have power show completion then if I do Docker and I have completion here as well.

195
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,740
Look at that.

196
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,100
All right.

197
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,470
So we got everything working but this is a pretty neat show.

198
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,710
You do not have to use this for this course.

199
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,460
I do expect that everything works in here before it works in here.

200
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,300
So if you're having problems here don't come running to the Q&amp;A just yet.

201
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,140
Actually just try and get a partial window to see if it works because it might be something messed up

202
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,510
with Commander but it's a neat option.

203
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,760
And I tend to run it whenever I'm using Windows.

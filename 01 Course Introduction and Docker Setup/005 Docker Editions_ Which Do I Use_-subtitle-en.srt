00:04.960 --> 00:07.020
OK I want to get you right into Docker.

1
00:07.030 --> 00:12.490
Before we get to Docker, we got to actually have Docker. We've got to install it; and in order to install it,

2
00:12.490 --> 00:12.610
you

3
00:12.610 --> 00:16.500
you need to know which edition you need to put on your machine.

4
00:16.560 --> 00:19.290
We're going to go through that real quick.

5
00:19.300 --> 00:22.240
Basically, there's a dozen or more editions of Docker now.

6
00:22.240 --> 00:28.820
Those are different "flavors," basically, for different operating systems. We need to go through

7
00:28.830 --> 00:33.430
real quick in this lecture, and in the few lectures after it, which one you're going to use for the course.

8
00:33.730 --> 00:38.140
You figure out which one that's going to be. You jump to the lecture that will set you

9
00:38.140 --> 00:41.590
up and install it, and then configure it properly for this course.

10
00:41.710 --> 00:47.020
We also learn real quick about the difference between the free Community Edition Docker, that's Docker

11
00:47.020 --> 00:53.400
CE, and then the EE version, the Enterprise Edition. We won't actually cover much of that in this course.

12
00:53.410 --> 01:00.100
It's a paid version and it's usually for larger business, but we'll touch on it every so often but you

13
01:00.100 --> 01:01.750
won't be using it in this course.

14
01:01.750 --> 01:06.250
We're going to use totally free software. You're also going to learn real quick what Stable and Edge

15
01:06.250 --> 01:11.240
are, how the releases are done, and which versions you should use.

16
01:11.290 --> 01:15.190
We've got to get you figured out to which one you're going to use and how

17
01:15.190 --> 01:15.530
you're going to use it.

18
01:15.760 --> 01:21.520
Do realize that Docker is not just a simple point and click installation sometimes because it's

19
01:21.580 --> 01:24.400
actually a much bigger product than it was four years ago.

20
01:24.400 --> 01:28.160
They've added a whole bunch of features that manage and solve a whole bunch of problems.

21
01:28.210 --> 01:33.040
So do realize that sometimes it seems a little more to install it than what is necessary because it's

22
01:33.040 --> 01:36.280
now such a bigger thing than a container runtime.

23
01:36.280 --> 01:37.850
It also moves really fast.

24
01:37.960 --> 01:38.190
The  

25
01:38.190 --> 01:40.680
container ecosystem is red hot, with innovation on a yearly basis.

26
01:40.690 --> 01:46.110
It's sometimes even hard to keep up when you're in the industry.

27
01:46.210 --> 01:51.020
Do realize that your version matters and you need to make sure that you're on the most recent version.

28
01:51.130 --> 01:57.220
If you follow the directions at the store, or if you follow my videos here, we'll get you there.

29
01:57.220 --> 02:00.740
Docker CE is the version we're going to focus on on this course.

30
02:00.820 --> 02:07.720
That is the free open source toolkit that is full of features and can get you from dev all the way through

31
02:07.720 --> 02:08.940
to production.

32
02:08.950 --> 02:14.040
There is another version called Docker EE, or Enterprise Edition, and we'll get to that in a second.

33
02:14.050 --> 02:16.020
There are three major types.

34
02:16.120 --> 02:21.090
I like to break down the different editions, of which there is now over a dozen, into

35
02:21.100 --> 02:23.380
three major types of installs.

36
02:23.380 --> 02:28.150
The first one is, you're just installing it directly on a supported operating system; meaning that it

37
02:28.150 --> 02:33.550
runs on that kernel and that OS and it's supported. Mostly until 2016,

38
02:33.550 --> 02:34.880
it was really just Linux.

39
02:35.140 --> 02:40.240
Then we started seeing innovations where the Raspberry Pi could use it, and we saw it on mainframes

40
02:40.360 --> 02:43.640
and other Linux variants or Unix variants started to use it.

41
02:43.810 --> 02:48.130
And then Windows Server 2016 supported it natively.

42
02:48.190 --> 02:50.510
So that's pretty exciting on the Windows side.

43
02:50.650 --> 02:55.940
But that's the direct method. On Mac and Windows 10, 

44
02:56.050 --> 03:05.020
I would call this, not the direct method, but more of a suite of tools including a GUI and settings

45
03:05.140 --> 03:11.830
preferences, to make it really easy for you to develop Linux containers, or now

46
03:11.830 --> 03:16.220
Windows containers, on either one of those operating systems. Because the Mac natively doesn't support Docker.

47
03:16.360 --> 03:21.310
So what has to happen in the background on the Mac, and also for Windows 10, is a small virtual machine

48
03:21.310 --> 03:26.500
has to be started by Docker to run the containers in. It's transparent to you 

49
03:26.500 --> 03:31.340
most of the time. You're never going to know it's there. But that is part of those editions.

50
03:31.360 --> 03:36.910
So they are a little bit different. The last option is the cloud. The cloud is really 

51
03:36.910 --> 03:39.640
what I would say are AWS, Azure, or Google versions.

52
03:39.640 --> 03:46.810
So Docker for AWS, for example. Those versions come with Docker installed on Linux usually, but they also

53
03:46.810 --> 03:49.540
come with features specific to that cloud vendor.

54
03:49.570 --> 03:56.260
So on the AWS side, it'll come with the cloud formation template, it'll come with persistent storage

55
03:56.260 --> 03:58.450
options for storing your databases.

56
03:58.460 --> 04:03.640
It will come with features that automatically update elastic load balancers and all those things that

57
04:03.640 --> 04:06.010
you would care about if you were in AWS.

58
04:06.010 --> 04:09.090
The same can be said for Azure and pretty soon Google Cloud, once it graduates from Beta.

59
04:09.100 --> 04:15.970
Those three different types of installs all come together to support

60
04:16.000 --> 04:21.670
a full life cycle of Docker options. In this course, we're really going to be focusing mostly on

61
04:21.670 --> 04:25.510
Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, and installing Linux locally

62
04:25.510 --> 04:32.200
if you're on a Linux machine, for local development and testing. At the end, we will start to create Swarms in the cloud,

63
04:32.200 --> 04:36.730
and then I'll give you options at that point on how to do that.

64
04:36.760 --> 04:42.830
A real quick note on the differences between CE and EE, and Stable vs. Edge.

65
04:42.940 --> 04:47.130
We mentioned that the Docker version we're really using, or the edition

66
04:47.140 --> 04:52.240
we're going to be using, is Docker Community Edition. That's CE; that's the free 

67
04:52.240 --> 04:52.990
open source version.

68
04:52.990 --> 04:59.230
The other version Docker EE, is Docker Enterprise Edition. It's a paid version that you pay per node.

69
04:59.230 --> 05:06.730
It's not necessarily ideal for the independent developer or the single person, it's really better

70
05:06.730 --> 05:12.580
for larger organizations that have lots of servers they need to run; and, they need maybe management GUI

71
05:12.880 --> 05:18.790
or LDAP authentication for active directory, or maybe they just need 24/7 phone support. 

72
05:18.790 --> 05:22.690
You can buy that on a monthly or a yearly subscription.

73
05:22.690 --> 05:24.270
And you do get a lot for it.

74
05:24.400 --> 05:31.460
They certify that EE version so it's specific versions of Linux and Windows. Then the Docker CE

75
05:31.510 --> 05:37.250
has a broader support where they generally test it a little bit on a bigger set of platforms.

76
05:37.330 --> 05:39.780
You'll see all of those at the store when you go to download it.

77
05:40.060 --> 05:44.410
If you're curious about the pricing of the Enterprise Edition, you can go to docker.com/pricing.

78
05:44.410 --> 05:49.180
Again, we're not going to discuss a whole lot about that in this course. We will mention it a few times,

79
05:49.660 --> 05:51.250
but you can check that out.

80
05:52.030 --> 05:57.490
And one last thing real quick, we just want to discuss the difference between the support life cycle

81
05:57.520 --> 06:02.170
and the versioning of CE, EE, and what Stable vs. Edge means.

82
06:02.170 --> 06:07.660
Edge actually means beta in the Docker world. It comes out every month.

83
06:07.840 --> 06:12.350
Unfortunately it's only supported for a month until the next beta comes out.

84
06:12.370 --> 06:18.070
I personally run Edge on my laptop because I like to test new Docker things. You may not want to do that.

85
06:18.070 --> 06:22.930
When you're downloading Docker by default, you will get the Stable version that comes out once 

86
06:22.930 --> 06:24.390
a quarter.

87
06:24.400 --> 06:29.770
You'll also notice that it actually looks like it's supported for four months on the Stable version

88
06:30.010 --> 06:36.400
because it kind of gives you that one month to actually install the next quarterly stable update before

89
06:36.400 --> 06:38.370
they stop updating the previous one.

90
06:38.380 --> 06:44.320
Of course if you want to pay for EE, you get longer support life cycles and patches for whatever version

91
06:44.320 --> 06:45.180
you decide to install.

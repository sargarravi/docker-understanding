            <h4>Windows Terminals</h4>

<p>On Windows you'll likely want to use PowerShell terminal rather than Command Prompt, but if you don't like the default GUI window that Microsoft provides, you might want to check out <a href="https://conemu.github.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>, or recommended by a student, <a href="http://cmder.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cmder</a>, which is built on ConEmu andeasier to get started. You'll want to change both of those options to always use PowerShell though.</p>

<h4>Windows PowerShell Tab Completion</h4>

<p>Tab completion lets you quickly fill the rest of a command or argument as you type by hitting Tab.To get "tab completion"in Windows, it's easiest to usePowerShell and install the posh-docker Module by <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#set-up-tab-completion-in-powershell" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">following this guide from the Docker Docs</a>.</p>

<h4>macOS Terminals</h4>

<p>On Mac you can use the built in Terminal program which uses the default Bash shell. I prefer to use <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iTerm</a> as my GUI terminal interface to gain more features than the built in one.</p>

<h4>macOSBash Tab Completion</h4>

<p>Tab completion lets you quickly fill the rest of a command or argument as you type by hitting Tab. Assuming you're running Docker for Mac, you'll want to connect up the completion scripts that come with Docker for Mac to your shell. <a href="http://blog.alexellis.io/docker-mac-bash-completion/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Captain Alex Ellis has a nice walk through of how to get this working</a>. If you're familiar with brew, Ifind his method more up to date then using the brew packages for Docker completion scripts.</p>

<h4>Linux</h4>

<p>In a desktop Linux distro like Ubuntu, Mint, etc. you'll likely need to do nothing. They already have good built-in terminals and Bash tab completion works out of the box. Happy days!</p>

<h4>What You See In This Course</h4>

<p>If you like the tools, theme, VIM, etc. as seen in this course on my Mac, I've got a list of tools in mysetup at <a href="http://www.bretfisher.com/shell" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.bretfisher.com/shell</a> that someday I'll turn into a tutorial, but mostly I'm just running their defaults.</p>

Hey there. My name is Bret and I'll be your instructor for this course.

1
00:09.050 --> 00:11.950
This is just a quick video about me.

2
00:11.960 --> 00:16.100
I been in I.T. for 20 years and I've done lots of things.

3
00:16.100 --> 00:17.510
I've worked in the Navy.

4
00:17.510 --> 00:21.710
I've worked for the federal government, local government, big business, little business.

5
00:21.860 --> 00:25.700
I've been a freelancer for 7 years now as a consultant.

6
00:25.700 --> 00:31.310
I've worked for startups. I've actually been a startup...so I have quite a diverse background but

7
00:31.310 --> 00:37.890
I've always been sort of an ops and sysadmin person with developer on the side sort of thing.

8
00:38.090 --> 00:42.820
I don't pretend to be the amazing developer like a lot of you probably are.

9
00:42.830 --> 00:48.920
I've been using Docker for over 3 years now and I've been teaching it almost as long.

10
00:48.930 --> 00:54.080
I pretty quickly got excited about Docker and realized how awesome the container ecosystem

11
00:54.080 --> 00:59.660
was going to become and saw that it was sort of the future of development and deployment and managing

12
00:59.660 --> 01:07.370
servers. I started the local Meetup for Docker in early 2016 and I speak a lot there and talked a

13
01:07.370 --> 01:08.730
lot with people there.

14
01:08.750 --> 01:13.940
I've been teaching at workshops and at conferences a lot for over a year and a half now so I've taught

15
01:13.940 --> 01:19.370
hundreds of people now how to use Docker and specifically orchestration and production concerns because

16
01:19.370 --> 01:23.240
that's my focus and I run a couple of local Meetups.

17
01:23.240 --> 01:24.350
I mentioned the Docker Meetup.

18
01:24.350 --> 01:27.980
I also run a Code for America Meetup. I'm very excited about that.

19
01:27.980 --> 01:30.510
You should totally check out Code for America.

20
01:30.950 --> 01:34.700
And I'm a big believer in community and open source in particular.

21
01:34.700 --> 01:41.870
So 3% of the profit for this course will actually be donated to a couple of charities that I

22
01:41.870 --> 01:47.060
really believe in: the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Free Software Foundation.

23
01:47.060 --> 01:49.370
And you should definitely check those out as well.

24
01:49.550 --> 01:56.710
When I'm not actually doing Docker in all of its forms I'm probably traveling with my wife or Crossfitting

25
01:56.780 --> 01:59.970
or cooking or gaming.

26
01:59.990 --> 02:05.090
So thanks so much for learning a little bit about me and I look forward to meeting you in the course

27
02:05.120 --> 02:06.860
in the Q&A or in the Slack chat.

            <p>I've mentioned Docker Hub, Docker Enterprise Edition DTR (Docker Trusted Registry), and Docker Registry as threeoptions for storing your images, but there are many 3rd party options out there.</p>





<p><a href="http://Quay.io" rel="nofollow">Quay.io</a> is a popular choice, and is very comparable to Docker Hub as a cloud-based image registry. Sysdig did a <a href="https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-docker-usage-report-2017/" rel="nofollow">Docker Usage Report in April 2017</a> based off their users that shows Quay as the most popular cloud-based choice.</p>









<p>If you're on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/" rel="nofollow">AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/" rel="nofollow">Azure</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/" rel="nofollow">Google Cloud</a>, they all have their own registry options that are well integrated with their toolset.</p>









<p>If you want a self-hosted option, there's <a href="https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition#/container_management" rel="nofollow">Docker EE</a>, <a href="https://quay.io/plans/?tab=enterprise" rel="nofollow">Quay Enterprise</a>, and also GitLab, which comes with <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/05/23/gitlab-container-registry/" rel="nofollow">GitLab Container Registry</a>, among others.</p>









<p>There's a much larger list of registries over at the <a href="https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker#hosting-images-registries" rel="nofollow">Awesome Docker</a> list.</p>
